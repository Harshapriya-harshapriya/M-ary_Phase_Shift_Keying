# M-ary_Phase_Shift_Keying
•	Designing of M-ary PSK (BPSK and QPSK) modulator and demodulator circuit.
•	Simulation of modulation and demodulation of M-ary PSK (BPSK and QPSK) with
  relevant waveforms in MATLAB.
•	Comparative analysis of BPSK and QPSK in terms of Constellation diagrams, Bit Error
  Rate (BER) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).
